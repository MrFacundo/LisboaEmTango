		bio: `Oona has been teaching TTMS for several years and is a popular
        teacher thanks to her cheerful and carefree manner. Oona about
        herself: After completing my bachelor's degree in "Arts du
        spectacle" in France, I discovered tango argentino in Lyon in
        2008, trained and danced daily, traveled to festivals, and soon
        after started teaching. Movement has always been close to my
        heart: starting with classical ballet, jazz dance, karate and rock
        'n' roll, my passion finally culminated in the improvised couple
        dance tango. At the end of 2009 I returned to Berlin, continued to
        dance tango excessively and started my master's degree in "Dance
        Studies" at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin.`,

		bio: `He began tango at the early age of 14 as a competitive escenario dancer. 
		While he no longer does stage performance, his early exposure to tango gave him 
		tremendous passion for tango music and a keen focus for learning. After working 
		through University Tango Clubs he moved to Berlin, Germany where he now teaches.
		 Malachai focuses heavily in his teaching on the connection required to create 
		 complex movements from numerous tango styles. His number one goal is to share 
		 the tools for his students to be musical, comfortable and creative.`,
